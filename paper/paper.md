# Introduction:
Natural language processing (NLP) forms the link between machine language 
(binary code) to natural languages (which we humans speak). It borrows elements
from artificial intelligence, computer science and information engineering.
Success of NLP is highly dependent on how one can successfully program computers,
to process, analyze and interpret huge amounts of natural language data. Key
challenges/opportunities in this inter-disciplinary field involves speech 
recognition, language interpretation and generation of natural language from a
machine representation. With NLP, it is possible for computers to read text, hear
speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important

# Natural language text processing:

It is well known that quite a bit information which exists out in our world is
very unstructured. The challenge would be to make a computer to understand this
and extract data from it. Take English language as an example. Humans have been
writing down things for thousands of years but computers can’t yet truly
understand the language as we do. The trick is to break down the process of
understanding English into smaller chunks and understanding each smaller piece
separately [[@fa18-523-67-www-google-2].

The text is manipulated for abstractions and indexed for automatic knowledge
extraction. Producing text in a desirable format is one of the major research
areas in NLP. structuring of large bodies of textual information to retrieve a
information is classified under the Natural language text processing.
> "The central
task for natural language text processing systems is the translation of
potentially ambiguous natural language queries and texts into unambiguous
internal representations on which matching, and retrieval can take place
[@fa18-523-67-NLP-1].

Past research concentrating on natural language text processing systems has been
reviewed by many including [@fa18-523-67-NLP-2]
Terminologies:

The various important terminologies of Natural Language Processing are: -
-	Phonology - refers to the systematic arrangement of sound
-	Morphology - comprises of nature of words where the different parts of the
  words represent smallest units.
-	Lexical - Interprets the meaning of the sample word.
-	Syntactic - Rectifies the grammatical mistakes in a sentence.
-	Semantic- determines the meaning of the word by pivoting on the interactions
  among word-level meanings in the sentence.
-	Discourse - Focusses on properties of the text that convey meaning by making
  connections between component sentences [@fa18-523-67-NLP-3].
-	Pragmatic - It is concerned with the firm use of the language [@fa18-523-67-NLP]. 

# Natural Language generation

This happens in four phases:
-	Identifying the goal
-	Evaluating the situation and planning to achieve the goal
-	Evaluate the available resources.
-	Execute the plans as text [@fa18-523-67-NLP-Art].

# Related Work

Researchers working on NLP, building tools and systems which makes NLP what it
is today. Tools like Sentiment Analyzer, parts of speech, Emotion detection,
Semantic Role Labelling etc made NLP a good topic for research.

- Sentiment Analyzer: analyses the document for positive and negative words.
  It uses the sentiment lexicon and the sentiment pattern database to analyze the
  sentiments.

- Parts of speech: It can efficiently tag and classify words as nouns, adjectives,
  verbs etc. Taggers are already present for the  European languages, research is
  being done on making parts of speech taggers for other languages like Arabic,
  Sanskrit [@fa18-523-67-NLP-Art-1], Hindi [@fa18-523-67-NLP-Art-2] etc.
  

- Emotion Detection: This is like sentiment analysis, but it works on social media
  platforms on mixing of two languages. It categorizes statements into six groups
  based on emotions [@fa18-523-67-NLP-Art-3].

- Sematic Role Labelling: SRL works by giving a semantic role to a sentence.
  like assigning roles to words that are arguments of a verb in the sentence
  [@fa18-523-67-NLP-Art-4].

# Applications of NLP

Natural Language Processing can be applied into various areas like Machine
Translation, Email Spam detection, Information Extraction, Summarization,
Question Answering etc.

- Machine Translation: As the name suggests Machine translation is translating a
  phrase from one language to another with the help of engines like google
  translate. The major challenge in machine translation is keeping the meaning and
  the grammatical structure of the translated language intact.

- Text categorization: splitting the large volume of data into several categories.
  Example spam filters.

- Spam Detection: Various machine learning techniques like Rule Learning,
  Naïve Bayes, Memory based Learning, Support vector, Decision Trees,
  Maximum Entropy Model etc are used to detect the spams.This is very similar to 
  text categorization [@fa18-523-67-NLP-Art].

# NLP in Yelp data review

The first step in NLP depends on the application. Voice based systems like Google
Assistant or Alexa translates words into text using Hidden Markov Models. 
The language and context is then understood through a series of coded grammar
rules that rely on algorithms that incorporate statistical machine learning. 
Another important step is Semantic analysis which helps interpret human 
sentences logically [@fa18-523-67-www-google-1]. 

We shall turn our focus on how this powerful technique could be used to interpret
restaurant reviews on Yelp through a sentiment analysis model. The goal of this
paper is to predict whether a user liked a local business or not based on their
review on Yelp. A simple text classifier would be built based on Python’s Pandas,
NLTK and Scikit-learn libraries. The plan would be to start with a dataset
containing 5000 reviews with the following info:

-	ID of the restaurant under review
-	ID of the posted review
-	Date the review was posted
-	The star rating provided.
-	The text for the review [@fa18-523-67-www-google-3].

NLTK library would be used to process the text and get basic information and
insight on the data. The next step would be to visualize the data by utilizing
histogram grids for every star rating. The goal would be to identify which feature
of the review is useful in finding correlations in the dataframe. Once we derive
some useful correlations, they could be visualized.
Challenges faced in NLP text processing:

-	Scalability and potability
-	Certain techniques are too expensive
-	Not very reliable as of now.
-	Speech/text processing [@fa18-523-67-www-google-4].
